# Flip-It-Puzzle-Game
DESCRIPTION: A recreation of the classic electronic game 'Lights Out!'

NOTE: For those who want to edit the files, please do not directly edit the master branch. Instead, make a fork or another branch and edit to your heart's content there. Also, please put your name on any branches/forks you made so I can sort them out later. (If you'd like, also add a comment with your name on your additions to the source code.) If you find anything wrong with the code, please add on the README file in your respective version (with forking/branching etc. as long as you don't directly edit the master branch)

OBJECTIVE: The goal of the game is to turn all the squares to the 'on' position

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain things in this version of the game are not working:

*  The JLabel in Main class with the note reading 'note that not all puzzle positions are solvable' is not appearing below the 'reset' and 'randomize' buttons
*  There is no logic implementing the increase of dimensions by adding 2 new rows and columns to the gameboard
*  The size of the Squares are not fixed
*  The score does not increase when a square is clicked
