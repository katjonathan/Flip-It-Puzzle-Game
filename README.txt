# Flip-It-Puzzle-Game
A recreation of the classic electronic game 'Lights Out!'


Certain things in this version of the game are not working:

*  The JLabel in Main class with the note reading 'note that not all puzzle positions are solvable' is not appearing below the 'reset' and 'randomize' buttons
*  There is no logic implementing the increase of dimensions by adding 2 new rows and columns to the gameboard
*  The size of the Squares are not fixed
